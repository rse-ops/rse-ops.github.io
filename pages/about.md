## About

The RADIUSS project promotes and supports a broad set of open source software developed over many years at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for use outside of their primary funding organization and within the broader scientific research community. With these libraries and tools we cover a wide range of features a team would need to develop a modern scientific simulation code, particularly when targeting High Performance Computing (HPC). Each of these products are used in applications that support the LLNL science mission, and will be supported and continuously developed for the foreseeable future. These are not research projects that will simply vanish if a lead developer finds other interests - but well-supported software backed by programs and sponsors, and supplemented with support through the RADIUSS project for broader use and external engagement.
