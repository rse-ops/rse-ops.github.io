<h1 id="policies-and-guidelines">Policies and Guidelines</h1>

<p>As part of the RADIUSS project, these open source products
follow a set of policies and guidelines (listed below) based on best
practices for open source development learned and adopted through
years of research and
development supporting production software running on the
worlds largest supercomputers. Some of these policies were derived
directly or indirectly from other similar documents <sup id="fnref:bss" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bss" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:xsdk" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:xsdk" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:sl" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sl" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
<sup id="fnref:wsc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wsc" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> listed at the
bottom of this page. By sharing these policies publicly, we
hope to encourage others to adopt similar standards for the
betterment of the open source software community, and welcome a
<a href="mailto:radiuss-request@llnl.gov">dialogue</a> on where we could
improve.</p>

<p>These policies and guidelines are not meant to be a comprehensive set
of recommendations for good software quality assurance (SQA) practices
(although many of them do promote that). Instead, these are policies
that we feel are particularly important for developers of open source
software to follow. We strongly believe that open source software will
not succeed by just being “put out there”. These policies are our
attempt to capture the things we feel are most important to a
successful open source project, beyond just good SQA practices that
any software engineer would promote.</p>

<p>We intend to continuously evolve these policies and guidelines
in the future. In particular, tools mentioned are not eternal and
best practices evolve rapidly, demanding flexibility in our approaches. However, we
attempted to make these recommendation as generic as possible, so that
they could apply to the various types of projects RADIUSS supports,
and likewise may serve to others. While we try not to interfere in project’s
management, with found it important and relevant to focus our support
effort on a subset of fundamental tools, so that knowledge and
practices can easily be shared, and for the sake of interoperability.</p>

<p>RADIUSS and the projects it covers are open-source and primarily (or
by now, exclusively) use
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> for repository management. These policies and guidelines are
themselves part of the <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/llnl.github.io">GitHub repository</a> that automates the
building and updating of <a href="https://software.llnl.gov">LLNL’s Software
Portal</a>, to which you are welcome to submit an
issue or pull request to help us evolve these policies.</p>
