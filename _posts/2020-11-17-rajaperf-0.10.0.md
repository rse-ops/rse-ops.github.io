The RAJA performance suite ([RAJAPerf](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf)) is designed to explore performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications. Specifically, it is used to assess, monitor, and compare runtime performance of kernels implemented using RAJA and variants implemented using standard or vendor-supported parallel programming models directly. Each kernel in the suite appears in multiple RAJA and non-RAJA (i.e., baseline) variants using parallel programming models such as OpenMP and CUDA. The v0.10.0 release changes the way kernel variants are managed.
