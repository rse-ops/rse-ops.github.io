MacPatch -- used at LLNL to manage 3,000+ computers -- simplifies the act of patching and installing software on macOS-based systems. The client relies on using the built-in software update application for patching the macOS system updates and its own scan and patch engine for custom patches. v3.3.0.2 is a major release with a completely new UI and the backend updated to Python 3.
