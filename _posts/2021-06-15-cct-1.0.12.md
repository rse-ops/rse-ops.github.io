The [Coda Calibration Tool (CCT)](https://github.com/LLNL/coda-calibration-tool) calculates reliable moment magnitudes for small- to moderate-sized seismic events. This release replaces all plots with new HTML5 based plots that utilize PlotlyJS and D3.js. In addition, CCT now has updated navigation buttons and menu items, additional data exposed in the UI, upgrades to waveform and spectral plots, and much more.
