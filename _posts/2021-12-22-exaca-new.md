[ExaCA](https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA) is a cellular automata (CA) code for grain growth under additive manufacturing conditions by ExaAM within the Exascale Computing Project. ExaCA runs with the default enabled Kokkos backend and has been tested with Serial, OpenMP, Pthreads, CUDA, and HIP backends. Supplementary temperature data files are available in the [ExaCA-Data](https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA-Data) repo.
