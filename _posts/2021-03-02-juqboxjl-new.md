[Juqbox.jl](https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl) is a package for solving quantum optimal control problems in closed quantum systems, where the evolution of the state vector is governed by Schrodinger's equation. See the project's README for installation instructions and workflow details. A few examples are also provided.
