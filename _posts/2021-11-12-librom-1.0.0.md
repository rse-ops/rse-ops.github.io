[libROM](https://github.com/LLNL/librom) is lightweight, scalable C++ library for data-driven physical simulation methods from the intrusive projection-based reduced order models to non-intrusive black-box approaches. The first official release adds the capability to create a sample mesh and relevant DOF maps for samples in an arbitrary number of finite element spaces.
