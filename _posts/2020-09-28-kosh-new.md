[Kosh](https://github.com/LLNL/kosh) allows codes to store, query, share data via an easy-to-use Python API. Kosh lies on top of Sina and, as a result, can use any database backend supported by Sina. This software aims to make data access and sharing as simple as possible. The repo includes [installation instructions](https://github.com/LLNL/kosh/blob/stable/INSTALL.md).
