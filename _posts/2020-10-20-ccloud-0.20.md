LANL led with LLNL contributors, [Charliecloud](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud) provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources. Version 0.20 includes a significant improvement for unprivileged image build via `ch-grow`, meaning Dockerfiles will no longer fail or need to be altered in order to succeed.
