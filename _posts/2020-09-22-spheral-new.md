[Spheral++](https://github.com/llnl/spheral) ([documentation](https://spheral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) provides a steerable parallel environment for performing coupled hydrodynamical and gravitational numerical simulations. Hydrodynamics and gravity are modeled using particle based methods (SPH and N-Body). Features include:
- Total energy conserving compatible hydro mode
- ASPH (Adaptive Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) algorithm
- Fluid and solid material modeling
- Damage and fracture modeling in solids
