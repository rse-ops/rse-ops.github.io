[UMT](https://github.com/LLNL/UMT), which stands for Unstructured Mesh Transport, is an LLNL [ASC](https://asc.llnl.gov) proxy application (mini-app) that solves a thermal radiative transport equation using discrete ordinates (Sn). It utilizes an upstream corner balance method to compute the solution to the Boltzmann transport equation on unstructured spatial grids. For additional information, the repo's README includes references to relevant radiation transport publications.
