[PolyClipper](https://github.com/LLNL/PolyClipper) is a C++ reimplementation of the geometric clipping operations in the R3D library originally written by Devon Powell, as documented in the paper [Powell & Abell (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999115003563). This release transforms PolyClipper to a header-only C++ library.
