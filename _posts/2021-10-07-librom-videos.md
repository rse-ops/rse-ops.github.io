Reduced order models (ROMs) combine data and underlying first principles to accelerate physical simulations, reducing computational complexity without losing accuracy. The C++ software library called [libROM](https://github.com/LLNL/librom) provides data-driven physical simulation methods from intrusive projection-based ROMs to non-intrusive black-box approaches. The project has a new [website](http://librom.net/) that contains documentation and examples. Additionally, computational scientist Youngsoo Choi has recorded three user tutorials, with plans to record more in the future:

- [Physics-informed sampling procedure for reduced order models](https://youtu.be/A5JlIXRHxrI) (9:25)
- [Poisson equation and its reduced order model](https://youtu.be/YlFrBP31riA) (7:15)
- [Poisson equation and its finite element discretization](https://youtu.be/YaZPtlbGay4) (6:34)
