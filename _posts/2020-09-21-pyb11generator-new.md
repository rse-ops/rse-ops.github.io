[PYB11Generator](https://github.com/LLNL/PYB11Generator) is a python based code generator that creates pybind11 code for binding C++ libraries as extensions in Python. The software parses input that is very close to writing the desired interface in native python, turning this into the corresponding pybind11 C++ code. The repo includes [documentation](https://pyb11generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
