[CHAI](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI) is a C++ library providing an array object that can be used transparently in multiple memory spaces. CHAI can be used standalone, but is best when paired with the RAJA library, which has built-in CHAI integration that takes care of everything. This release catches CHAI up to the new version nomenclature for the RAJA Portability Suite, which has changed format to indicate year, month, and patch number.
