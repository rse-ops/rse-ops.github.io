[Quandary](https://github.com/LLNL/quandary) provides optimal control for open quantum systems via an optimization solver. The underlying quantum dynamics model open quantum systems, using the Lindblad master equation to evolve a density matrix in time. With this latest release, Quandary can solve either Lindblad's master equation for the density matrix (open quantum systems), or Schr√∂dinger's equation for the state vector if no collapse operators are present (closed quantum systems). The latter drastically reduces the computational complexity; however, system interactions with the environment are not considered in this model.
