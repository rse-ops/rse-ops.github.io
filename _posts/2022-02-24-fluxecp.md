The LLNL-developed [Flux](https://github.com/flux-framework) project addresses challenges posed by complex scientific research supercomputing workflows, and the team has played a major role in the Exascale Computing Project's [ExaWorks](https://exaworks.org/) effort. A recent [ECP article](https://www.exascaleproject.org/the-flux-supercomputing-workload-manager-improving-on-innovation-and-planning-for-the-future/) describes how Flux works, its impact, and what's next for the project.
