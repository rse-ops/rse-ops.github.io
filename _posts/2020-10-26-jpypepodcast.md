Python and Java are two of the most popular programming languages in the world, and have both been around for over 20 years. In that time there have been numerous attempts to provide interoperability between them, with varying methods and levels of success. One such project is [JPype](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype), which allows you to use Java classes in your Python code. In this [Python podcast episode](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/jpype-java-python-bridge-episode-286/), lead developer Karl Nelson from LLNL explains why he chose it as his preferred tool for combining these ecosystems, how he and his team are using it, and when and how you might want to use it for your own projects. He also discusses the work he has done to enable use of JPype on Android, and what is in store for the future of the project. The episode runs 48:39.
