[PyMFEM](https://github.com/mfem/PyMFEM) provides Python binding for [MFEM](http://mfem.org/), a high-performance parallel finite element method (FEM) library. Installer (`setup.py`) builds both MFEM and binding together. By default, `pip install mfem` downloads and builds the serial version of MFEM and PyMFEM. Additionally, the installer supports building MFEM with specific options together with other external libraries, including MPI version.
