LLNL leads the Center. All of [CEED's software](https://github.com/ceed/) is open source.

CEED will hold its sixth annual meeting ([CEED6AM](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed6am/)) on August 9-11 in a hybrid format: in-person at the [Siebel Center for Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus in Urbana and virtually using ECP Zoom for videoconferencing and Slack for side discussions.
