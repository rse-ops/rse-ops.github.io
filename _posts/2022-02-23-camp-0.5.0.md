[CAMP](https://github.com/LLNL/camp) collects a variety of macros and metaprogramming facilities for C++ projects. This version incorporates BLT updates to better support rocm builds, and uses the cmake setup to include a binary component that lets CAMP avoid pulling in expensive standard library headers at include time.
