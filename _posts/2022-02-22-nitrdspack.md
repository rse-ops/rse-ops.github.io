The [Spack](https://spack.io/) team [presented a long-term roadmap](https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/images/2021/MAGIC-Todd-Gamblin-12012021.pdf) at the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development ([NITRD](https://www.nitrd.gov/)) Program's recent meeting on software sustainability. NITRD coordinates federal research and development to identify, develop, and transition into use the Unites States' IT, HPC, networking, and software capabilities. With more than 6,000 software packages and nearly 1,000 contributors, Spackâ€™s long-term strategy is based around broad adoption and collaboration. Current R&D efforts include a multi-year [strategic initiative](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/build) aimed at reducing the human maintenance burden, as well as improvements to Spack's continuous integration workflow and sustainability plans after the conclusion of the Exascale Computing Project.
