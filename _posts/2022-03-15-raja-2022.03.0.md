[RAJA](https://github.com/LLNL/raja) is a software abstraction that systematically encapsulates platform-specific code to enable applications to be portable across diverse hardware architectures without major source code disruption.

Note that the release version nomenclature has changed format to indicate year, month, and patch number. This format applies to the coordinated release of RAJA Portability Suite components. The v2022.03.0 release includes:

- features that support SIMD/SIMT programming
- ROCTX support to enable kernel naming
- expanded CUDA execution policies
- improved CMake logic for using CUB
- updated submodules
- and more

As of this release, RAJA requires CMAKE version 3.14.5 or newer and a C++14-compliant compiler to build.
