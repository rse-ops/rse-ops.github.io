The [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) development team ran a user survey from September 28 to October 9 and received 169 responses. The survey covered user demographics, use cases, feature priorities, community involvement, and more. For example, responses indicated strong interest in a future virtual workshop. The [full analysis](https://spack.io/spack-user-survey-2020/) is available on the Spack website, and the survey data is housed in [its own repo](https://github.com/spack/spack-user-survey).
