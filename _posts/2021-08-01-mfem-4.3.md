[MFEM](https://github.com/mfem/mfem) is a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods. It enables high-performance scalable finite element discretization research and application development on a wide variety of platforms, from laptops to supercomputers. The v4.3 release includes many improvements and new features, such as:

- Variable order spaces, serial p- and hp-refinement
- Low order refined discretizations, solvers and transfer
- Preconditioners for advection-dominated systems
- Support for GPU solvers from *[hypre](https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre)* and [PETSc](https://github.com/CEED/PETSc)
- GPU-accelerated mesh optimization algorithms
- Explicit vectorization for Fujitsu's A64FX ARM microprocessor
- Support for high-order Lagrange meshes in VTK format
- New and improved integrations with [FMS](https://github.com/CEED/FMS) (Field and Mesh Specification), [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper), [libCEED](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED), [Ginkgo](https://ginkgo-project.github.io/)
- 11 new [examples and miniapps](https://mfem.org/examples/)
- and much more!
