categories: event
---

Held since 2012, LLNL's hackathons are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNLâ€™s missions. Like the hackathons of the past year, the spring event (April 29-30) will be held virtually using WebEx and Mattermost for collaboration. LLNL sponsors are two Computing divisions: Enterprise Applications Services and National Ignition Facility Computing.
