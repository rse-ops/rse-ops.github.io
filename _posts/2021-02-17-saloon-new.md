[Saloon](https://github.com/LLNL/Saloon) is a Vim plugin that simplifies Python code linter/fixer configuration and usage. Saloon's menu lets developers toggle which static analysis tools to use and delegates those changes to [ALE's](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) API. Since [prospector](http://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) already handles multiple tools, and is integrated with ALE, most of the actual linting will initially be handled via prospector calls. See the project's README for information about how to get started using Saloon.
