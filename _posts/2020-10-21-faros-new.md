[FAROS](https://github.com/LLNL/FAROS) is a framework for benchmarking and analysis of compiler optimization. The repo contains a benchmark harness to fetch, build, and run programs with different compilation options for analyzing the impact of compilation on performance. The use case is contrasting OpenMP compilation with its serial elision to understand performance differences due to different compilation. The README file contains information about how the software works. The team has published [a paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58144-2_1) with more details and [recently won](https://computing.llnl.gov/newsroom/computing-trio-wins-best-paper-award-openmp-workshop) the Best Paper Award at the 2020 International Workshop on OpenMP (IWOMP).
