The Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations ([CEED](https://github.com/CEED)) within the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s ECP is helping applications leverage future architectures by developing state-of-the-art discretization algorithms that better exploit the hardware and deliver a significant performance gain over conventional methods. [libCEED](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED) is a high-order API library that provides a common algebraic low-level operator description, allowing a wide variety of applications to take advantage of the efficient operator evaluation algorithms in the different CEED packages. This major release includes support for matrix assembly (mainly intended for low order and coarse grids), new HIP and MAGMA backends with kernel fusion, Julia and Rust interfaces, and more.
