Exascale computing will transform the ability to tackle some of the worldâ€™s most important challenge. The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) celebrates this new era of scientific discovery with the now-annual Exascale Day on October 18, or "10^18" to represent the exascale threshold of floating-point operations per second. This [virtual event](https://www.exascaleproject.org/exascale-day-2021/) runs all week and provides multimedia and articles that educate explain the impact areas of exascale computing from the Department of Energy national laboratories (including LLNL), HPC manufacturers, and universities and industrial organizations. Much of the ECP's software stack is open source.
