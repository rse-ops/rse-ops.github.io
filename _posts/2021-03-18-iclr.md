LLNL computer scientists have developed [a new framework](https://data-science.llnl.gov/latest/news/novel-deep-learning-framework-symbolic-regression) and an accompanying visualization tool that leverages deep reinforcement learning for symbolic regression problems, outperforming baseline methods on benchmark problems. The [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=m5Qsh0kBQG) was recently accepted as an oral presentation at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2021), one of the top machine learning conferences in the world. The conference takes place virtually May 3-7, and the team's deep symbolic regression code is available in the [deep-symbolic-regression GitHub repo](https://github.com/brendenpetersen/deep-symbolic-regression).
