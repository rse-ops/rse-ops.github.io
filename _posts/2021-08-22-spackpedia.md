In a new twist on documentation, the Spack package manager team created the Spack Encyclopedia, or [Spackpedia](https://spack.github.io/spackpedia/), to help users understand frequently used (and sometimes funny) terms. Click on a term to see a quick definition with an option to read more. Click "read more" for additional details about the term, an example of its usage, a link to Spack documentation, and related terms. Spackpedia is a [separate repo](https://github.com/spack/spackpedia) within the [Spack organization](https://github.com/spack) on GitHub, and contributions are welcome.
