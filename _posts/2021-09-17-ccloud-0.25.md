LANL led with LLNL contributors, [Charliecloud](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud) provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources. Version 0.25 bundles the Python module Lark (which no longer needs to be installed externally), updates how SSH data is handled in the build, and includes several other fixes and improvements.
