[MFEM](https://github.com/mfem/mfem) is a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods. It enables high-performance scalable finite element discretization research and application development on a wide variety of platforms, from laptops to supercomputers. The v4.4 release includes:

- upgraded solvers, such as improved formatting of iterative solvers output and support for [*hypre*](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/hypre-scalable-linear-solvers-multigrid-methods) on AMD GPUs
- meshing improvements, such as new [TMOP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09807)-based methods and initial support for meshes with pyramidal elements
- discretization improvements, such as GPU-enabled partial and element assembly support for discontinuous Galerkin methods
- several new [examples and mini-apps](https://mfem.org/examples/)
- updated [documentation](https://docs.mfem.org/)
- and much more
