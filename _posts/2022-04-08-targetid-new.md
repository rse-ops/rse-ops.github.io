[TargetID](https://github.com/LLNL/TargetID) is a drug target and chemotype identification pipeline that enables rapid identification and characterization of binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as the core chemical components with which these sites interact. The repo contains three Jupyter Notebooks and input data files.
