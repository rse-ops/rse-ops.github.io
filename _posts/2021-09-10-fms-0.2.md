As part of the [Exascale Computing Project's](https://exascaleproject.org/exascale-computing-project) [CEED software suite](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/software/), [FMS](https://github.com/CEED/FMS) provides a high-order Field and Mesh Specification interface that allows a wide variety of applications and visualization tools to represent unstructured high-order meshes with general high-order finite element fields defined on them. FMS is intended as a lightweight format and API that can represent general finite elements within a common, easy to use framework. This includes high-order solutions and meshes as well as non-standard finite elements, such as Nedelec and Raviart-Thomas elements. Version 0.2 includes:

- Lightweight API to represent general finite element meshes + fields
- I/O in ASCII and [Conduit](https://github.com/LLNL/conduit) binary format
- FMS visualization support in [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov) v3.2
- Common, easy-to-use framework
