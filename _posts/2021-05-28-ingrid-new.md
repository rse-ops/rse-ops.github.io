[INGRID](https://github.com/LLNL/INGRID) (Interactive Grid) is a Python-based tokamak edge plasma grid generator capable of automatic generation of grids for magnetic topologies with up to two x-points anywhere in the domain. INGRID can be utilized in a GUI mode and noninteractively via Python scripts; both modes of operation support the use of the YAML-formatted parameter file. The repo provides [installation instructions](https://ingrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and a [guide to getting started](https://ingrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).
