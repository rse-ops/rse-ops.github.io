[krowkee](https://github.com/LLNL/krowkee) is a toolkit for scalably and efficiently summarizing many data streams in distributed memory. It is intended for applications where one needs to summarize huge loosely structured data, such as matrices or graphs, and where individual components such as rows/columns or vertex adjacency information are impractical to store and directly inspect.
