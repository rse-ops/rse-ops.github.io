LLNL hosts hundreds of student interns annually—even during a year distinguished by the COVID-19 pandemic. This summer, the [Computing Scholar Program](https://computing.llnl.gov/careers/interns) welcomed 160 undergraduate and graduate students into virtual internships. The Lab’s open source community was already primed for student participation. A Computing news article [describes three open source projects](https://computing.llnl.gov/newsroom/open-source-software-community-welcomes-virtual-internships) that benefitted from interns' help: [Ascent](https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent), [MFEM](https://mfem.org), and this website. Mentors discuss the challenges of mentoring remotely, while students describe their experiences including skill development.

Another version of this story is available as a [Code.gov](https://code.gov/) blog post, penned by Ian Lee: [Spotlight Story: Interns and Open Source: A Productive Combination](https://medium.com/codedotgov/spotlight-story-interns-and-open-source-a-productive-combination-d03cba28b280).
