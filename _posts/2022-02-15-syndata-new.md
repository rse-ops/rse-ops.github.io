[SYNDATA](https://github.com/LLNL/SYNDATA) includes a suite of statistical/machine learning models to generate discrete/categorical synthetic data. To train each model, the user must provide the input data from which the model parameters will be inferred. Once the models are trained, they can be used to generate entirely synthetic data. In addition to the actual models, SYNDATA includes code to process data, evaluate results (based on cross validation), and create a PDF report.
