The [Coda Calibration Tool (CCT)](https://github.com/LLNL/coda-calibration-tool) calculates reliable moment magnitudes for small- to moderate-sized seismic events. This release adds two significant features including energy calculations (*BETA*) and a new data table filter feature. The current beta code integrates theoretical spectra to determine empirically the necessary integration constant to give the correct energy value. In the final version of the code, this will be tied to the analytical form of the seismic energy.
