[Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper) is a program instrumentation and performance measurement framework. It is designed as a performance analysis toolbox in a library, allowing one to bake performance analysis capabilities directly into applications and activate them at runtime. The latest release includes the ability to run ConfigManager configs without the ConfigManager API, improvements to sampling and symbol lookup, loop profiling for the Spot config, documentation updates, and more.
