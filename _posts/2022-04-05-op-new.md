[op](https://github.com/LLNL/op) is a lightweight general optimization solver interface. Its primary purpose is to simplify the process of integrating different optimization solvers (serial or parallel) with scalable parallel physics engines. From a user perspective, optimization problems can be described abstractly, and op guarantees portability for different optimization engines and optimization problem configurations.
