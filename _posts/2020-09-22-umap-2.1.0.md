[Umap](https://github.com/LLNL/umap) provides an mmap()-like interface to a simple, user- space page fault handler based on the userfaultfd Linux feature. The use case is to have an application specific buffer of pages cached from a large file (i.e., out-of-core execution using memory map). This release includes a new API, a sparse multi-file backing store interface, and new build options.
