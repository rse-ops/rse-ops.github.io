[MuyGPyS](https://github.com/LLNL/MuyGPyS) is a Gaussian process estimation method that affords fast hyperparameter optimization by way of performing leave-one-out cross-validation. The latest release overhauls the handling of the `sigma_sq` parameter. Additionally, the [tutorial](https://github.com/LLNL/MuyGPyS/tree/v0.4.0/docs/examples) has moved out of the README and into Jupyter Notebooks.
