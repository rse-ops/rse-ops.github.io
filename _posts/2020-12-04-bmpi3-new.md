MPI is a large library for run-time parallelism where several paradigms coexist. It was is originally designed as standardized and portable message-passing system to work on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. The last standard, MPI-3, uses a combination of techniques to achieve parallelism, Message Passing (MP), Remote Memory Access (RMA),and Shared Memory (SM). [[Boost].MPI3](https://github.com/LLNL/b-mpi3) is a C++ library wrapper for standard MPI3. While not an official MPI3 library, [Boost].MPI3 is designed following the principles of Boost and the STL. This repo provides a uniform interface and abstractions for MPI3 features by means of wrapper function calls and concepts brought familiar to C++ and the STL.
