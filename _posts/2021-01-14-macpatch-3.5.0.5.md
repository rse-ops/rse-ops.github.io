MacPatch -- used at LLNL to manage 3,000+ computers -- simplifies the act of patching and installing software on macOS-based systems. The client relies on using the built-in software update application for patching the macOS system updates and its own scan and patch engine for custom patches. v3.5.0.5 is a major release with a agent installation tracking, dynamic patch list, updated MPAgentUploader, and more.
