[Aluminum](https://github.com/LLNL/Aluminum) provides a generic interface to high-performance communication libraries with a focus on allreduce algorithms. Blocking and non-blocking algorithms and GPU-aware algorithms are supported. Aluminum also contains custom implementations of select algorithms to optimize for certain situations. This, the v1.0.0 release, is stable and includes refactored communicators, a `barrier` operation, and support for vector collectives.
