Magpie allows Hadoop and similar data analytics frameworks to run on LLNLâ€™s HPC systems. Magpie instantiates the framework within the context of a batch job -- rather than on a persistent, dedicated cluster -- and by reading and writing from the Lustre parallel HPC file system instead of local disk drives.

v2.1 includes support for several versions of Hbase, Spark, Hadoop, and Zeppelin.
