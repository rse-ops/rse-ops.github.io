[HiOp](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop) is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. This lightweight HPC solver leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels. This version includes

- interface update for running mixed dense-sparse problems in the device memory space
- interface for PARDISO linear solver
- porting of sparse linear algebra kernels to device
- and more!
