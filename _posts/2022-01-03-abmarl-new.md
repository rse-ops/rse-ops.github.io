[Abmarl](https://github.com/LLNL/Abmarl) is a package for developing Agent-Based Simulations and training them with MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). It provides an intuitive CLI for engaging with the full workflow of MARL experimentation: training, visualizing, and analyzing agent behavior. Abmarl leverages RLlibâ€™s framework for reinforcement learning and extends it to more easily support custom simulations, algorithms, and policies. [Documentation](https://abmarl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is also available.
