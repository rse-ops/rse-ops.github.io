The RAJA performance suite ([RAJAPerf](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf)) is designed to explore performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications. Specifically, it is used to assess, monitor, and compare runtime performance of kernels implemented using RAJA and variants implemented using standard or vendor-supported parallel programming models directly. The v0.11.0 release adds new kernels, features, and runtime options.
