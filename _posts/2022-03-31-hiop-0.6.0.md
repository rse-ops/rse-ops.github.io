[HiOp](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop) is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. This lightweight HPC solver leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels. This version includes the primal decomposition (PriDec) solver for structured two-stage problems as well as improved support for NVIDIA GPUs for solving sparse optimization problems.
