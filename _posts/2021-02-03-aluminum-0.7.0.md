[Aluminum](https://github.com/LLNL/Aluminum) provides a generic interface to high-performance communication libraries with a focus on allreduce algorithms. Blocking and non-blocking algorithms and GPU-aware algorithms are supported. Aluminum also contains custom implementations of select algorithms to optimize for certain situations. In this release, the testing and benchmarking infrastructure has been rewritten to be significantly more comprehensive and cleaner. The repo also now includes scripts for nicely plotting benchmark results.
