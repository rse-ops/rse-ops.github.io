[Quandary](https://github.com/LLNL/quandary) provides optimal control for open quantum systems via an optimization solver. The underlying quantum dynamics model open quantum systems, using the Lindblad master equation to evolve a density matrix in time. The control problem aims to find control pulses that drive the system to a desired target state. The README contains installation information as documentation is under development.
