The Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations ([CEED](https://github.com/CEED)) within the US Department of Energyâ€™s ECP is helping applications leverage future architectures by developing state-of-the-art discretization algorithms that better exploit the hardware and deliver a significant performance gain over conventional methods. [libCEED](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED) is a high-order API library that provides a common algebraic low-level operator description, allowing a wide variety of applications to take advantage of the efficient operator evaluation algorithms in the different CEED packages. This release includes portability improvements, GPU support for helper utility functions, mini-app improvements, and more.
