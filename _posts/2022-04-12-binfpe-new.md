[BinFPE](https://github.com/LLNL/BinFPE) detects floating-point exceptions (NaN, infinity, and subnormal quantities) in NVIDIA GPU applications using binary instrumentation. It requires no re-compilation of the application and can analyze libraries. The tool extends [NVBit](https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit), which is provided by NVIDIA Labs to analyze binaries.
