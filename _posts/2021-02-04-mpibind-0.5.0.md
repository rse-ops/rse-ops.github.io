[mpibind](https://github.com/LLNL/mpibind) is a memory-driven algorithm to map parallel hybrid applications to the underlying heterogeneous hardware resources transparently, efficiently, and portably. Unlike other mappings, its primary design point is the memory system, including the cache hierarchy. Compute elements are selected based on a memory mapping and not vice versa. Several new incremental versions have been released simultaneously:

- [Autotools + test suite v0.2.0](https://github.com/LLNL/mpibind/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
- [Flux plugin v0.3.0](https://github.com/LLNL/mpibind/releases/tag/v0.3.0)
- [Affinity programs v0.4.0](https://github.com/LLNL/mpibind/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
- [Support for I/O devices v0.5.0](https://github.com/LLNL/mpibind/releases/tag/v0.5.0)
