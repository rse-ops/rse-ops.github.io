[HiOp](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop) is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. This lightweight HPC solver leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels. This version includes:

- a Newton interior-point solver for nonlinear nonconvex optimization
- capabilities to solve optimization solvers with mixed dense and sparse (MDS) blocks
- support for GPU-based acceleration of MDS linear algebra
