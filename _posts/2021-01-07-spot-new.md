SPOT is a web-based visualization tool for performance data. One use case is to link the [Caliper performance library](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper) into an application, and every run of the application will produce a .cali performance data file. SPOT will then visualize the collective performance of an application across many runs. This could involve tracking performance changes over time, comparing the performance achieved by different users, running scaling studies across time, and so on.

We now have three repos that provide different functionality around SPOT:

- [spotfe](https://github.com/LLNL/spotfe): front-end code
- [spotbe](https://github.com/LLNL/spotbe): back-end code
- [spot2_container](https://github.com/LLNL/spot2_container): container recipe

To get started, fork `spot2_container` and let it check out the other two repos as submodules.
