- [caliper-compiler](https://github.com/LLNL/caliper-compiler) contains compiler tools for [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper), a library for integrating performance profiling capabilities into applications.
- [clippy-tutorial](https://github.com/LLNL/clippy-tutorial) includes a Binder tutorial for the [CLIPPy](https://github.com/LLNL/clippy) Python interface to HPC resources.
- [merlin-spellbook](https://github.com/LLNL/merlin-spellbook) provides utilities for [Merlin's](https://github.com/LLNL/merlin) HPC machine learning workflows.
