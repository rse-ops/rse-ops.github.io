[Pytaridx](https://github.com/LLNL/pytaridx) is a Python interface for reading and appending tar files, while keeping a fast index for finding and reading files in the archive. This interface has been successfully used to store and manage over one billion files in one of the Pilot-2 simulation campaigns.
