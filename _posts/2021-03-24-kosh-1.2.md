[Kosh](https://github.com/LLNL/kosh) allows codes to store, query, share data via an easy-to-use Python API. Kosh lies on top of Sina and, as a result, can use any database backend supported by Sina. This software aims to make data access and sharing as simple as possible. In this backwards-compatible release:

- Operators are introduced allowing the composition of features from one or many sources.
- Feature selection without extraction is now possible via the new execution graphs introduced in this release.
- Execution graphs are the recommended way to use Kosh going forward, as reflected in the updated notebooks.
