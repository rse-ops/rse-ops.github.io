[HiOp](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop) is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. This lightweight HPC solver leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels. This version includes centers on sparse optimization solver and enhanced support for device computations, including:
- Development of a sparse NLP solver and associated sparse NLP interface
- Update of the mixed dense-sparse NLP solver to support full GPU compute mode
- Implemented gradient-based scaling of the problem
- and more!
