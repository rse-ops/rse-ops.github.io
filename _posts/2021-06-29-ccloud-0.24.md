LANL led with LLNL contributors, [Charliecloud](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud) provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources. In version 0.24, `ch-image` is architecture aware, and the `ch-run --bind` destination path defaults to host. Many other commands are updated or improved, and the mailing list is set to announce-only.
