The [Merlin](https://github.com/LLNL/merlin) team has published a paper in *Future Generation Computer Systems* that describes Merlin’s machine learning–integrated workflow system and the considerations driving its design. The authors detail Merlin’s performance results on LLNL’s Pascal and Sierra supercomputers. For example, to demonstrate Merlin’s scalability, researchers created an unprecedentedly large fusion simulation dataset consisting of the multivariate results of approximately 100 million individual simulations on Sierra. Other case studies show Merlin’s flexibility in cascading and iterative scientific workflows.
