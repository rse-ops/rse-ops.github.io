categories: event

Held since 2012, LLNL's hackathons are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNLâ€™s missions. Like the spring hackathon earlier this year, the summer event (August 6-7) will be held virtually using WebEx and Mattermost for collaboration. LLNL sponsors are Livermore Computing and the Center for Applied Scientific Computing.
